## Systems and Modules
I love TTRPGs (tabletop role-playing games) and everything that comes with them. Though I like to play then (especially asthat is less work), my real passion is in crafting them.
As such, I will post modules (adventures, one-shots, etc) that I have ran and finished. This way, I can share what I've spent so many hours doing and not give away everything to my players as they will already have played.

As always, you are encouraged to make each your own, shaping the game to your players and their characters.

## Systems
Though most of my time is spent in 5e, I generally prefer to try a myriad of different systems. Similarly, if we are playing 5e, I am more likely to write a whole adventure than a handful of modules.
With that in mind, I will expand the systems list as I post more. Maybe even sort and link them. Maybe.
For now, the list of systems is just what I've played/run.
- Call of Cthulhu
     - I really enjoyed the Call of Cthulhu system. It tasted like Grin in the expectation of death, but lacked the inevitability of it. That is great for longer form games because it adds a strong sense of accomplishment just for surviving.
     - [The Haunting, revised](the_haunting.md)
- [Grin by Arcana Games](https://www.arcana-games.com/grin)
    - A favorite of mine and of my players, Grin is a one-shot system where death is _very_ nearly inevitable. Its selling point is its simplicity: the game requires only a deck of cards. Jokers are instant death, insanity, or other character-disabling mishap. Everything else is success. Thanks to its simplicity and lethality, it is a great way to kill an hour or two with zero prep.
    - I will eventually turn this into its own page as I come up with more alternate rules. For now, feel free to use the following:
        - **Face Defeat**: Face cards make the resulting success less desirable, with each face card in a single draw (no matter the total number of cards drawn) making the success progressively worse.
        One face card could be a minor injury such as a scrape or bruise.
        Three face cards in a single draw could be a permanent hit to a character's sanity or all of their gun misfiring.
