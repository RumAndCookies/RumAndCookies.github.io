## Modules
I love TTRPGs (tabletop role-playing games) and everything that comes with them. Though I like to play then (especially asthat is less work), my real passion is in crafting them.
As such, I will post modules (adventures, one-shots, etc) that I have ran and finished. This way, I can share what I've spent so many hours doing and not give away everything to my players as they will already have played.

As always, you are encouraged to make each your own, shaping the game to your players and their characters.

## Systems
Though most of my time is spent in 5e, I generally prefer to try a myriad of different systems. Similarly, if we are playing 5e, I am more likely to write a whole adventure than a handful of modules.
With that in mind, I will expand the systems list as I post more. Maybe even sort and link them. Maybe.
For now, the list of systems is just what I've played/run.
- Call of Cthulhu
     - I really enjoyed the Call of Cthulhu system. It tasted like Grin in the expectation of death, but lacked the inevitability of it. That is great for longer form games because it adds a strong sense of accomplishment just for surviving.
