## Welcome to The Haunting, revised

The Haunting is the intro module to Call of Cthulhu, written by [Chaosium](https://www.chaosium.com/). It is available for free in the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition quick start rules.


### Revised?

Aye, I found the module somewhat lacking, so I wrote some updates for my players' playthrough. You may want to read through the original module first to really get a sense of the changes.

Credit and rights to Chaosium. I do not own any of the IP; I'm just a fan.
